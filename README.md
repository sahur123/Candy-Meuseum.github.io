# Candy-Meuseum

This is a very basic website I built for practicing my HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills. This project gave me insight of using grid system in Bootstrap and how can I make things easily with Bootstrap.

Feel free to fork this and start building your own or add into it. Below is the link you can visit this website.
